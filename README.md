# Snake Game
## The classic snake game, now for web

This is a game developed by me with the help of a tutorial in YouTube from the channel "Web Dev Simplified".

The next things I am going to develop are:

1. An interface for mobile devices
2. A prettier alert window
3. A win case 
4. Change the colors
5. Options to modify the speed and the grow-rate of the snake.
